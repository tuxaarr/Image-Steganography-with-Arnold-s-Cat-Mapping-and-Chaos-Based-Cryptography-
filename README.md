# Image-Steganography-with-Arnold-s-Cat-Mapping-and-Chaos-Based-Cryptography-
The proposed system combines chaos-based cryptography and  steganography into a two-layer security mechanism. 
At the first level, Chaotic Card encrypts the secret data into an incomprehensible format that is much harder to extract without authorization.
At the second level, the encrypted data is embedded into the digital image using  LSB substitution or other adaptive techniques to minimize distortion of the cover image and maintain undetectableness.  
We analyze the system performance by determining key system performance metrics  such as PSNR, MSE, and embedding capacity. 
We also analyze  how the system responds to steganography attacks such as noise injection, clipping, and compression. Experimental results are presented that show that adding this chaos-based encryption significantly improves the security and reliability of the steganography system without degrading the quality of the stego image
